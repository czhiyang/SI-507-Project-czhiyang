Compared to Project 2 in SI 507, the tree is far more complicated as thereâ€™s multiple requirements. After some search, the K-means clustering +decision tree data structure establishment strategy is currently used. The program first extracts the minimum and maximum price, whether a studio, and floor plan information from the cached file and feeds it into the K-means algorithm and it will cluster the data as well as label them. Then we call the decision tree algorithm from the sk-learn module to generate the decision tree.
